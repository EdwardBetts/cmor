,Description of key columns:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"""minimal model configuration"" lists minimal (combination) of components needed to carry out the experiment.  It is understood that it is o.k. to run these experiments with additional components (like interactive chemistry, carbon cycle, or ice-sheet model).  So enter, for example, ""AOGCM CHEM"" *only* if an interactive chemistry model is required in a coupled model experiment.  Similarly enter ""AOGCM BGM"" only if a biogechemical model is required in a coupled run.  Reserve the term ""ESM"" for use in AOGCM BGM simulations when atmospheric CO2 concentration is calculated (i.e., emission-driven runs of a ""AOGCM BGM"").  Options are: • AGCM (atmospheric general circulation model, with land model), • OGCM (ocean general circulation model with sea-ice model), • AOGCM (atmosphere-ocean global climate model), • LAND (the land model component of a model but run “offline”), • ISM (ice-sheet model), ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,column G:    ,,,,"• BGM (biogeochemical  model that at the very least accounts for carbon reservoirs and fluxes in the atmosphere, terrestrial biosphere, and ocean; when run with atmospheric concentration calculated, specify ESM rather than ""AOGCM BCM""), • RAD (radiation code component of atmospheric model but run “offline”),• CHEM (for models that calculate ozone, rather than rely on prescribed concentrations,• AER (for models that calculate tropospheric aerosols driven by emissions fluxes, rather than relying on prescribed concentrations),• SLAB (a slab-ocean model).      • ESM (AOGCM couple with a BCM and run with atmospheric concentration calculated, based on emissions, etc.;  for concentration-driven runs with a BCM, specify ""AOGCM BCM"")                                                    ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,column O:,,,,"The experiment_id is used in constructing file names, and providing unique identifiers of experiments within CMIP6.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,column V:,,,,Transcribe the experiment labels you plan to use in the final version of your GMD article into this column.
